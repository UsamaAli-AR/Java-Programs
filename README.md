# Java Study Projects Repository

Welcome to the Java Study Projects repository! This repository hosts a variety of simple Java programs I've crafted while exploring the depths of Java programming. These programs cover a range of concepts and topics, acting as both examples and exercises to deepen your understanding of Java.

## üåü Introduction

Java is a robust and versatile programming language widely used for building diverse applications, from desktop to web and mobile. This repository aims to provide hands-on examples to grasp the fundamentals of Java programming.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To dive into these projects, ensure you have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Download and install Java from the official [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Use any Java IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans to open and run these projects.

Once set up:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-study-projects.git`.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Explore the projects in the `src` directory.
4. Run the individual Java files to see the programs in action.
5. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of Java concepts.

## üìã Project List

Here's a glimpse of the projects included in this repository:

1. **HelloWorld**: A classic introductory program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **Calculator**: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
3. **PalindromeChecker**: A program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
4. **FibonacciSeries**: Generates Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.
5. **PrimeNumberChecker**: Determines whether a given number is a prime number or not.
6. **SimpleInterestCalculator**: Calculates simple interest based on principal amount, rate, and time.
7. **TemperatureConverter**: Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.
8. **FactorialCalculator**: Calculates the factorial of a given number.

These projects cover fundamental Java concepts such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions/methods, and more.
